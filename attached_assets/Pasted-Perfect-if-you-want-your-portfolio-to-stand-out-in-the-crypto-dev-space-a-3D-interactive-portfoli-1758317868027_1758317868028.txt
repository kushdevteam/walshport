Perfect — if you want your portfolio to stand out in the crypto/dev space, a 3D interactive portfolio is the way to go. Since you’ve done games, we can lean into a gamified vibe where visitors explore your portfolio instead of scrolling. Here’s a concept design you can build with Three.js + React (via React Three Fiber), plus some structure ideas:

⸻

🌐 Concept: “Devverse” Portfolio

Imagine your site as a mini 3D world that people can navigate like a lightweight game.

1. Landing Scene
 • A 3D floating planet or space station (crypto/gamedev vibes).
 • Background: animated stars, nebula, or cyberpunk cityscape.
 • Interactive Camera: Mouse or WASD to rotate/explore.
 • A holographic title: “[Your Name] – Web3 & Game Dev”.
 • Floating “orbs” or “doors” that link to sections: About, Projects, Skills, Contact.

⸻

2. Navigation

Instead of a menu, you have 3D portals:
 • About Me → floating avatar or terminal that plays your intro.
 • Projects → gallery of 3D cubes/cards that expand into case studies.
 • Skills → rotating hologram with icons (React, Solidity, Unity, etc.).
 • Contact → futuristic console with clickable buttons (email, GitHub, X/Twitter).

⸻

3. Project Showcase
 • Each project is a 3D object:
 • Game project → a floating arcade cabinet that shows gameplay.
 • Website project → a 3D laptop with the site running inside (iframe texture).
 • Clicking = zooms camera in + shows details (stack, challenges, links).

⸻

4. Easter Eggs (Gamification)
 • Hidden clickable NFTs, coins, or tokens scattered around.
 • Collecting them unlocks a “secret project” or CV download.
 • Adds crypto/game flavor without being gimmicky.

⸻

5. Tech Stack for Implementation
 • Three.js or better: React Three Fiber (R3F) → makes it easier to integrate in React.
 • Framer Motion 3D → smooth camera transitions.
 • drei (R3F helpers) → prebuilt controls, loaders, environment.
 • GLTF Models → design some 3D assets (Blender) and import them.

Here’s a minimal React + Three.js structure to get started:

// App.jsx
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { OrbitControls, Environment } from "@react-three/drei";
import { Suspense } from "react";
import Projects from "./Projects";
import Hero from "./Hero";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="w-screen h-screen">
      <Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5], fov: 60 }}>
        <Suspense fallback={null}>
          <Environment preset="city" />
          <Hero />
          <Projects />
        </Suspense>
        <OrbitControls enableZoom={false} />
      </Canvas>
      {/* Optional UI Overlay */}
      <div className="absolute bottom-4 left-4 text-white font-mono">
        Use mouse/keys to explore 🚀
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

This gives you:
 • A full 3D scene,
 • Orbit controls for interactivity,
 • A structure where you can drop in “Hero” (your intro) and “Projects” as 3D objects.

👉 Question for you:
Do you want me to design a full portfolio flow (pages/assets/animations) in code (like a ready-to-run starter), or do you prefer a concept wireframe mockup first so you can decide the vibe before we dive into code?
